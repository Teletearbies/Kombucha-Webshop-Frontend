This is a webshop created for Kalles Kombucha company as a third semester project. The webshop allows customers to browse the list of products along with their description and price. Customers can register on the site with their personal information and can add products to a basket, which automatically calculates the total price. Completed orders generate a receipt for the customer and an internal message sent to the warehouse with the order information. The webshop also includes a map that shows physical locations where Kalles Kombucha products are being sold.
 
## Why the project is useful
The webshop allows Kalles Kombucha to expand their business by making it possible for customers to order products online. It provides a platform for customers to access all the necessary information about the products, prices and the locations where the products are being sold. The webshop also makes it easier for Kalles Kombucha to manage their business as it includes an administrator login which allows the customer to add, edit and remove items.
