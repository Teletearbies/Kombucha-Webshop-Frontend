            Kalle is the new hot shot on the kombucha scene╰(*°▽°*)╯
        </h3>
        <p class="p">
            In the past few months, he has started kombucha manufacturing facility to test his brand on the big market.
            His idea came from the pure curiosity of
            experimenting on flavors, a combination he enjoyed for a long time. It wasn't his first idea to produce
            his own products, but the timing was off with one of his local bottling companies and other suppliers in
            the brewing industry, causing him to rethink his ideas.<br>
            After careful research, kombucha became a definite possibility. He was inspired by his wife who drank it
            on a regular basis for its health benefits.
            He started experimenting in his home kitchen with real sugar, whole leaf green tea, and spirulina, a
            type of blue-green algae, a functional ingredient he uses in most of his flavors. After experimenting
            with a lot of different ingredients and his wife was born the Kalle's Kombucha Company.<br>
            "With spirulina, you're looking at five times the protein of soy protein, which is eight times the
            protein of chicken, and also the omega-3s, but in such a lesser quantity," Kalle says. "So, my goal in
            making this product was to provide a product that is highly beneficial for the consumer."
            What he experienced after creating his own formula for kombucha was "magnificent" customer reaction. As
            the brand started gaining traction in the local market, he decided to expand his business to a bigger
            facility.<br>
            The company certified and audited by the NSF International. They met their goal and now
            have a facility with four fermenters for kombucha and two different processing machines. They test each
            batch for chemical, microbiological, and physical parameters, which they created with their own
            proprietary formulas.
            "As far as sustainability is concerned, we are definitely looking into organic options. In the long run,
            that is really our goal," Kalle says.
            Once he comes up with a new flavor, Kalle makes samples by first making it to the store, where the
            customer can get to taste the latest type of kombucha. Also, here on the official Kalle's Kombucha site
            you have the chance to order any of the available <a class="navK" href="products.html">products.</a>
        </p>
        <h3 class="section__headerK">Fun fact</h3>
